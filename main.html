    <!-- Paragraph -->
    <p>
        I want to become a software developer because I enjoy solving problems,
        building creative solutions, and learning new technologies. Programming
        allows me to turn ideas into real applications that can help people and
        make daily tasks easier. I am motivated by continuous learning,
        innovation, and the opportunity to work on exciting projects that
        challenge my skills and help me grow professionally.
